# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "🔧 AUTHENTICATION & MODAL BUG FIXES: Please fix the following two bugs related to authentication and email modal behavior: 1) MOBILE LOGIN ISSUE - When users sign in on mobile, they are redirected to the homepage but remain logged out. Fix this so that login persists correctly and the user is signed in. Make sure the session token is saved (likely in localStorage as 'english_fiesta_token') and that the frontend reflects the signed-in state across page loads. 2) EMAIL POPUP ISSUE - The ConvertKit email modal currently appears twice, even after being closed once. It should appear only once for non-signed-up users and never again after being dismissed. Also, the 'X' button in the modal currently does nothing. Please make the 'X' properly close the modal."

      message: "AUTHENTICATION & MODAL BUG FIXES IMPLEMENTED: Fixed two critical production bugs: (1) 🔧 MOBILE LOGIN ISSUE: Enhanced AuthContext.js authentication flow - reordered token storage before state updates, replaced window.location.pathname with window.history.replaceState for better mobile compatibility, added timing delay for state completion, improved useEffect logic to prevent loops and handle session_id parsing correctly. (2) 🔧 EMAIL MODAL ISSUE: Enhanced EmailCaptureModal.js to prevent double display - added check for 'email_capture_dismissed' in initial logic, added modalShown flag to prevent double triggering, improved handleClose with proper event handling, enhanced backdrop click to only close on direct backdrop clicks, improved X button styling and accessibility, fixed auto-close after subscription. Both fixes target mobile-specific issues and modal persistence problems. Ready for testing to verify mobile authentication works and modal appears only once per user."

      message: "FOCUSED REVIEW TESTING COMPLETED (92.9% SUCCESS): Completed focused testing of the 3 specific areas requested in the review: (1) ✅ PROGRESS TRACKING: Progress tracking when videos are watched is working correctly - daily breakdown and recent activity are properly populated when videos are watched, with only minor tolerance differences in recorded vs expected minutes. (2) ✅ ADMIN FILTER MANAGEMENT: All admin authentication for filter management endpoints working perfectly - GET /api/admin/topics, GET /api/admin/countries, GET /api/admin/guides all correctly require admin authentication and reject invalid tokens. (3) ✅ CMS CONTENT MANAGEMENT: Content management endpoints properly secured - GET /api/admin/content and PUT /api/admin/content/{content_type}/{section_key} both require admin authentication and reject unauthorized access. All requested fixes are working as designed. Only 1 minor test failure out of 14 tests (progress tolerance issue) - core functionality is solid."
