The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the English Fiesta platform, adapting dynamically to evolving user requirements. Initially tasked with simple  integration, the focus quickly shifted to implementing a comprehensive Admin Content Management System (CMS) with a WYSIWYG editor for all public-facing text. This involved significant backend and frontend development, refactoring existing components to use dynamic content. Following this, the engineer implemented Mark as Watched and Add to My List functionalities, requiring updates to video components and new backend endpoints. The latest work involved building a Daily Goal system and integrating a detailed Language Levels section based on the Dreaming Spanish methodology, alongside extensive UI/UX improvements. The trajectory concludes with the user requesting administrative access to test CMS features, and the AI engineer investigating the authentication system to fulfill this.

<product_requirements>
English Fiesta is a luxury, mobile-friendly language learning platform using the comprehensible input method, providing an immersive, visually motivating experience for English learners.
**Previously Implemented:** Comprehensive progress tracking (minutes, streaks, levels), robust video library,  page with browsing/filtering, ConvertKit email subscriptions, secure Emergent Auth with role-based access (guest, student, instructor, admin), advanced tracking (Mark as Watched, Manual Activity Logging), Admin Video Upload System (direct/YouTube embeds), and initial UI foundation with basic multilingual prep.
**Current User Requirements & Implementation Focus:** The user prioritized an **Admin Content Management System (CMS)** for code-free editing of all public-facing content (FAQ, About, Hero, Footer, UI text, tooltips) in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, requiring a WYSIWYG editor (TipTap). Subsequently, **Mark as Watched** and **Add to My List** buttons were requested for videos with specific modal/toggle behaviors and API integrations. Most recently, a **Daily Goal system** (progress bar, goal setting modal, minute tracking, Mark as Unwatched toggle) and a **Your Language Level** section (Dreaming Spanish model, 7 levels with descriptions, expandable cards, PDF link, tooltip) were requested, alongside UI/UX enhancements and text fixes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed the implementation of the Your Language Level section within the Progress tab and had performed significant UI/UX enhancements across the  component. This included adding seven detailed language level cards () with responsive design, color-coded gradients, and expandable modals. Text changes were also applied (e.g., Manual Activities to Outside Activities, Platform Videos to English Fiesta videos). Crucially, the Learning Activity chart in  was refactored to display real user progress data instead of sample data, with improved styling, gradient backgrounds, and the integration of the English Fiesta logo. Overall, the visual appeal and branding of the Progress tab were substantially enhanced.

The AI engineer then provided a comprehensive development log (Chat Message 258) summarizing all work from inception to present. Following this, the user reported an error trying to edit content in the Hero Section via the preview environment, stating they couldn't create content and requested access to a staging/development environment with admin permissions to fully test CMS features. The AI engineer's immediate action was to investigate the backend authentication setup in  to understand how admin users are managed and to determine how to grant the user admin permissions for testing the CMS. The latest finding is that the system automatically designates the *first user to sign up as an admin*.

<optional_next_step>
Check the current user accounts in the database to identify if an admin user already exists or if the user needs to sign up as the first user to gain admin privileges.
