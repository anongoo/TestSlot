The trajectory outlines the transition from initial MVP development to a critical bug-fixing and feature enhancement phase for the English Fiesta application. The previous AI engineer delivered key features like CMS, progress tracking, and commenting. This trajectory began with the current AI engineer addressing immediate production bugs: mobile login persistence and email modal behavior. Subsequently, the focus shifted to a major UI overhaul, specifically replacing the native video player with , redesigning the watch page, and fixing related interaction issues. The process involved systematic debugging, dependency management, and iterative refinement of React components and state management, culminating in a fully functional video playback experience and a cleaner UI, ensuring all identified critical bugs are resolved and the core functionalities are production-ready.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with resolving critical bugs related to the video player and user experience on the English Fiesta application, following a comprehensive UI overhaul.

The work primarily focused on:
1.  **Login Redirect Issue:** The mobile login bug, where users were redirected to the homepage but remained logged out, was fixed. The  was modified to ensure the  is correctly saved to  (), and the post-login redirect now defaults to  or a previously stored path, ensuring the user is signed in across page loads.
2.  **Email Modal Behavior:** The ConvertKit email modal, which appeared twice and had a non-functional X button, was rectified in . It now appears only once for non-signed-up users, is properly dismissible via the X button, and does not reappear after dismissal.
3.  **Vime Video Player Integration and Functionality:** The core issue of the  player not appearing on the live site, scrubbing not working, and potential double-stacking was addressed.
    *   **Root Causes Addressed:**
        *   The use of  instead of  for video sources, preventing proper video loading, was corrected in .
        *   Player initialization timing issues and double rendering were fixed by adding a unique  prop to the  in  and ensuring proper mounting sequences with  state and  in .
        *   Event handler binding was confirmed and refined within .
    *   **UI Overhaul Completion:** The  component was significantly refactored to remove visual clutter, integrate a responsive  for related videos and metadata, and display a non-intrusive  for guest users. Thumbnail fallbacks in  were fixed.
    *   **Scrubbing Functionality:** Confirmed that native Vime controls enable reliable forward/backward scrubbing on site-hosted videos on both desktop and mobile.
    *   **Debugging Tools:** A  mode was added to  to overlay timestamps, playback state, and video URL for future troubleshooting.

All these critical bugs have been resolved, and the application's foundation is restored, offering a clean, professional, and fully functional video learning experience.
