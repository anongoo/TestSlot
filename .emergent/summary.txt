The AI engineer successfully progressed the English Fiesta platform through distinct phases. Initially, core features like progress tracking, video library, and ConvertKit integration were established, along with a robust Emergent Authentication system. A recurring UI bug (duplicate banner) was consistently addressed. Advanced tracking for Mark as Watched and Manual Activity Logging was then implemented, enhancing the progress dashboard. The project then transitioned to a phased approach, starting with Phase 1: Content & UI Foundation (Hero, Guest Homepage, About, FAQ, Footer), which was successfully completed and verified with screenshots. Phase 2 involved building a comprehensive Admin Video Upload System (chunked uploads, extended video model, admin dashboard) which was also completed and tested backend-first. Currently, the engineer is working on Phase 3: Email Capture & Multilingual Preparation, specifically integrating  and converting existing UI elements (Hero, Footer, About, FAQ, Email Subscription Banner) to use translation keys.

<product_requirements>
English Fiesta is a luxury, mobile-friendly language learning platform based on the comprehensible input method. It aims to provide an immersive and visually motivating experience for learning English.

**Implemented Features:**
*   **Progress Tracking:** Tracks daily/all-time minutes, visual streaks, personal bests, level-based progress, and milestones. Supports both session-based tracking for guests and persistent tracking for authenticated users, combining platform videos and manually logged activities.
*   **Video Library & Watch Page:** Offers clean browsing, filtering (level, category, accent, guide, country, length), keyword search, and free/premium content. Five sample videos are integrated. A dedicated  page with Watch, Series, and My List tabs has been created, allowing logged-in users to track watch history and saved videos, while guests can only browse.
*   **Email List Integration (ConvertKit):** Enables opt-in for motivational messages, updates, and promotions via a visible banner on the homepage and user dashboard.
*   **Authentication System:** Secure login/signup via Emergent Auth with session/token handling. Implements four custom roles: , , , and , with role-based access control and UI customization.
*   **Advanced Tracking Enhancements:** Includes a Mark as Already Watched feature for videos and a Manual Activity Logging system for external learning (Movies/TV, Audiobooks/Podcasts, Talking with friends) with duration, date, title/description, and difficulty. These contributions are equally weighted towards total hours and retroactive streak calculations.
*   **Admin Video Upload System:** Supports direct video uploads (MP4, MOV, AVI, max 5GB) and YouTube embeds. Includes comprehensive metadata fields (title, duration, description, level, accent, tags, instructor, country, category, premium, thumbnail), with chunked uploads and an admin dashboard for content management (edit/delete, badges for YouTube/Premium).
*   **Content & UI Foundation:** Implemented Hero section, Guest Homepage copy, About page, FAQ section, and a Footer with branding and links.
*   **Multilingual Preparation:** Initiated i18n structure with translation keys, and content storage in  format.

**Future Feature (Planned):**
*   **Instructor Booking:** Integrate Calendly for 1-on-1 class booking and Stripe for payments.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has just completed the comprehensive implementation of the dedicated  page with its tabbed navigation (Watch, Series, My List, and Progress for logged-in users) and the associated video playback and time-tracking logic. The homepage was also updated to remove direct video content and include a clear Browse Videos call-to-action linking to the new  page. Backend updates for the enhanced video model and robust chunked file upload system are also complete and tested.

Currently, the engineer is actively working on **Phase 3: Email Capture + Multilingual Prep**. This involves:
1.  **Integrating **: The necessary packages (, ) have been installed.
2.  **Setting up i18n structure**:  (i18n configuration) and  (multilingual content for About/FAQ) have been created.
3.  **Applying translation keys to existing components**:  has been updated to initialize i18n. , , , and  have been modified to use  for their text content and pull content from the new . A new  component has been created and integrated into the .
