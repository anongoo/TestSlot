<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully transitioned from initial application development (0 to 1) to a bug-fixing and enhancement phase. The work involved significant UI/UX improvements, integration of dynamic content, and robust backend support. Key decisions included using  for animations,  for rich text editing, and implementing a custom CMS. The previous work involved creating features like video commenting, Join the Team and Join a Class pages, and dynamic filtering. In the provided trajectory, the engineer diligently addressed two sets of critical production bugs, including video player functionality, progress tracking accuracy, authentication issues for admin features, social link updates, CMS editing persistence, manual video upload failures, and removal of an unwanted UI element. The approach was methodical, involving diagnosis, targeted code edits, and thorough verification, including re-builds and environment checks, ensuring stability and functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately before the initial summary request, the previous AI engineer completed the comprehensive editable filter controls system for the  page. This involved backend (, ,  models and CRUD APIs, ), admin UI (, , ), and frontend (, ) implementations. The engineer also fixed header button alignment and generated .

Following this, the current AI engineer received two sets of targeted bug fixes from the user:

**First Set of Fixes (6 Issues):**
1.  **Video Overlay:** The persistent black overlay on  was addressed, making it dismissible or hidden on play.
2.  **Video Player Controls:** Full native controls (seek, volume) were enabled for the video player in .
3.  **Progress Graph (Learning Activity Chart):** The  was updated to correctly map and render user  data from the backend, fixing the always-zero display.
4.  **Admin Auth for Filters:** Authentication issues in , , and  were resolved by ensuring the correct  from  was passed in API calls.
5.  **Social Links:** Updated Instagram and YouTube URLs in , and added TikTok with its correct URL.
6.  **CMS Editing:** The token issue in  was fixed by ensuring it used  for session management, allowing content changes to save and persist.

**Second Set of Fixes (3 Issues):**
1.  **Learning Activity Graph Redesign:** Further improvements were made to  to enhance the visual clarity of the bar graph. This included adjusting  baseline (from 60 to 30), increasing chart height (h-64 to h-80), adding a minimum bar height (8%), and providing value labels on hover.
2.  **Manual Video Uploader:** The manual video upload functionality () was fixed. The core issue was identified as a missing  dependency on the backend, which was installed. Necessary upload directories (, ) were also ensured.
3.  **Made by Emergent Button:** The unwanted  element was successfully removed from , requiring a forced frontend rebuild () to ensure the change took effect.

All requested fixes from both rounds have been applied, tested (via screenshots and backend tests), and confirmed as working, without introducing regressions.
